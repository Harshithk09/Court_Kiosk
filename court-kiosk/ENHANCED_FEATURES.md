# Enhanced Features - Addressing Your Questions

## 1. High-Resolution PDF Export for Flow Maps

### Problem Solved
The flow map images were becoming pixelated when zoomed in, making them difficult to read for court staff review.

### Solution Implemented
I've created **two specialized PDF export functions** specifically for flow maps:

#### **ExportFlowMapPDF** - Visual Flow Map
- **Landscape orientation** for better flow visualization
- **High-resolution vector graphics** that remain crisp at any zoom level
- **Grid layout** showing all nodes with clear labels
- **Legend** explaining node types
- **Professional formatting** suitable for court documentation

#### **ExportDetailedFlowMapPDF** - Detailed Documentation
- **Portrait orientation** for detailed reading
- **Step-by-step breakdown** of each node
- **Full descriptions** of what each step involves
- **Next steps** clearly outlined for each decision point
- **Page numbering** for easy reference

### How to Use
The PDF export buttons are now available in the **Flow Map header**:
- **"Export Flow Map PDF"** - Visual flowchart (landscape)
- **"Export Detailed Flow PDF"** - Detailed documentation (portrait)

### Benefits for Court Staff
✅ **Crystal clear at any zoom level** - No more pixelation
✅ **Professional appearance** - Suitable for court documentation
✅ **Easy to print and share** - Standard PDF format
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Both visual and detailed versions

## 2. Divorce Flow Support

### Ready for Abby's Return
The system is **fully prepared** to support divorce flows when Abby returns with the flow data.

### What's Already Implemented
✅ **Generic flow loading system** - Works with any JSON flow structure
✅ **Flexible node types** - Supports decision, process, end, and custom types
✅ **Dynamic form detection** - Automatically identifies forms mentioned in flow
✅ **Extensible summary system** - Adapts to different flow types

### How to Add Divorce Flow
When Abby provides the divorce flow data:

1. **Save the flow JSON** as `divorce_flow.json`
2. **Update the flow loader** to include divorce flows
3. **Add divorce-specific forms** to the form database
4. **Test with the existing components**

### Example Integration
```javascript
// The system will automatically work with divorce flows
const divorceFlow = await loadGraph('divorce');
return (
  <DualPaneDemo 
    graph={divorceFlow}
    FlowWizardComponent={FlowWizardSynced}
    FlowMapComponent={FlowMap}
  />
);
```

## 3. Hyperlinked Forms in Summaries

### Problem Solved
Form codes were just text - users couldn't easily access the actual forms.

### Solution Implemented
**Complete form linking system** with:

#### **FormLink Component**
- **Clickable form codes** that open actual court forms
- **Form names and descriptions** displayed alongside codes
- **Direct links** to California Courts official forms
- **Download functionality** for offline use

#### **Enhanced Summary Display**
- **Completed forms** show as green checkmarks with links
- **Pending forms** show as checkboxes with links
- **Form descriptions** explain what each form is for
- **Complete form glossary** at the bottom of summaries

### Form Database
Currently includes all major DVRO forms:
- **DV-100**: Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order
- **DV-109**: Notice of Court Hearing  
- **DV-110**: Temporary Restraining Order
- **DV-200**: Proof of Service
- **DV-105**: Child Custody and Visitation Order
- **DV-140**: Child Custody and Visitation Order Attachment
- **DV-800**: Firearms Restriction Order
- **FL-150**: Income and Expense Declaration
- **CLETS-001**: Confidential CLETS Information

### How It Works
```jsx
// Instead of plain text: "DV-100"
// Now shows as: "DV-100 (Request for Domestic Violence Restraining Order)" [View] [Download]
<FormLink formCode="DV-100" showDescription={true} />
```

### Benefits for Users
✅ **One-click access** to actual court forms
✅ **Clear form descriptions** - no confusion about what each form is
✅ **Download capability** - forms available offline
