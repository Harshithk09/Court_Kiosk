# ðŸ”§ Email Domain Verification Fix

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue**
Resend is blocking emails to any address except `karuturiharshith@gmail.com` because you're using their testing domain without verification.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Two Solutions**

### **Option 1: Quick Testing Fix (Immediate)**
For immediate testing, use your own email address in the kiosk:
- Enter `karuturiharshith@gmail.com` in the email field
- This will work immediately for testing the enhanced email content

### **Option 2: Production Fix (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1: Verify Your Domain**
1. Go to [resend.com/domains](https://resend.com/domains)
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `courtkiosk.com` or `sanmateocourt.org`)
4. Follow the DNS verification steps
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)

#### **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**
Add this environment variable to your Render backend:

```bash
RESEND_FROM_DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

#### **Step 3: Redeploy**
The system will automatically use your verified domain for sending emails.

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Use a Different Email Service**

If you don't want to verify a domain, you can switch to a different email service:

### **Option A: SendGrid**
- More generous free tier
- No domain verification required for basic sending
- Easy to set up

### **Option B: AWS SES**
- Very reliable
- Good for high volume
- Requires AWS account

### **Option C: Mailgun**
- Developer-friendly
- Good documentation
- No domain verification for testing

## ðŸš€ **Quick Fix for Now**

To test the enhanced email content immediately:

1. **Use your own email**: Enter `karuturiharshith@gmail.com` in the kiosk
2. **Test the enhanced content**: You'll see the new detailed email format
3. **Verify it works**: Check that all the enhanced features are working
